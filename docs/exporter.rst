Exporter

One fundamental idea behind *anytree* is the common tree node data structure,
which can be imported from different formats and exported to different formats.

Available exporters:

.. toctree::
    :maxdepth: 1

    exporter/dictexporter
    exporter/jsonexporter
    exporter/dotexporter
    exporter/mermaidexporter
